Implementing Doc2Vec model on the kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/harmanpreet93/hotelreviews

Data set is from one of the leading travel site containing hotel reviews provided by customers. This data set provides reviews of a single hotel. This may suit the application of sentiment analysis.

The task is to define whether clients are happy or not by their reviews.
